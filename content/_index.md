## Hello there!


I am an economist in making. I am currently working with [Prof. Meghna Agarwala](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/meghna-agarwala-3/) at Ashoka University on the Project **Understanding Crop Residue Burning for Air Pollution in Delhi.**

I am an MSc graduate from [IGIDR, Mumbai](http://www.igidr.ac.in/) and BA(Hons.) from [Hindu Collge](https://hinducollege.ac.in/), [University of Delhi](http://www.du.ac.in/).

> There are two great problems in economics. One is allocation within the economy: how
quantities of goods and services and their prices are determined within and across markets.
This is represented by the great theories of general equilibrium, international trade, and
game-theoretic analysis. The other is formation within the economy: how an economy
emerges in the first place, and grows and changes structurally over time. This is represented
by ideas about innovation, economic development, structural change, and the role of
history, institutions, and governance in the economy. The allocation problem is well
understood and highly mathematized, the formation one less well understood and barely
mathematized^[WB Arthur, Economic complexity: A different way to look at the economy. Available [here](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/Comp.Econ.SFI.pdf)].

To be clear, I am interested in the later part.
