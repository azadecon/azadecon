## Hello there!


I am a Program Associate, Public Revenue-Delhi at [CEGIS](https://www.cegis.org/).
An economist in making, having previously worked with [Prof. Meghna Agarwala](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/meghna-agarwala-3/) and [Prof. Aparajita Dasgupta](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/aparajita-dasgupta/) at Ashoka University on the [Determinants of Crop Residue Burning in India]().

A first-generation learner, I am an MSc Econ graduate from [IGIDR, Mumbai](http://www.igidr.ac.in/) and BA(Hons) Econ from [Hindu Collge](https://hinducollege.ac.in/), [University of Delhi](http://www.du.ac.in/). I am interested in Institutions. In the words of [WB Arthur](https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/Comp.Econ.SFI.pdf),

> There are two great problems in economics. One is allocation within the economy: how
quantities of goods and services and their prices are determined within and across markets.
This is represented by the great theories of general equilibrium, international trade, and
game-theoretic analysis. The other is formation within the economy: how an economy
emerges in the first place, and grows and changes structurally over time. This is represented
by ideas about innovation, economic development, structural change, and the role of
history, institutions, and governance in the economy. The allocation problem is well
understood and highly mathematized, the formation one less well understood and barely
mathematized.
