# Problem(s) at hand

The survey data I was cleaning has responses which were not systematic and required interpretation. It contained spelling mistakes, has non-meaningful characters and data was simply not [tidy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).

## Resources
1. [The Carpentries](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/) have provided an amazing introduction to OpenRefine install and use OpenRefine.
2. This <a href="https://docs.openrefine.org/">manual </a>could be helpful when one delves deeper into the use.
3. Sometimes, [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/openrefine) could also be useful.
