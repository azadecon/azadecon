### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am `Arshad Azad`. I am a Project Associate at [CEGIS](cegis.org).


Previously, have been an RA with [Prof. Meghna Agarwala](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/meghna-agarwala-3/) at Ashoka University.

Check out my [website](https://azadecon.github.io) or you could reach me [here](mailto:azadecon@gmail.com).

[This](https://gist.github.com/bbdaniels/246867d78f07db5b2baecd0d8a22ef1a) is something I found interesting.
